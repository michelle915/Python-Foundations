# project-4a

Modify the binary search function from the exploration so that, instead of returning -1 when the target value is not in the list, raises a TargetNotFound exception (you'll need to define this exception class).  Otherwise it should function normally.  Name this function bin_except.

The file must be named: **bin_except.py**
