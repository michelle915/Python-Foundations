Modify insertion sort to sort a list of strings instead of numbers.  It shouldn't return anything - it should sort the list "in place".  The sorting should ignore case.  For example "Zebra" should come after "apple",  "maRker" should come after "marble",  etc.  Name this function string_sort.  After calling this function, the list that was passed in should now contain the exact same strings it did before, but in sorted order.

The file must be named: **string_sort.py**
